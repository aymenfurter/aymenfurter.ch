I recently built a Unity game with the help of ChatGPT, an amazing tool for developers. I included DALLE-2 for graphics and video game backgrounds. DALLE-2 provides an outpainting capability which allowed me to create truly incredible game world.

Years ago, I decided to build a multiplayer game named [Rescuebomb](https://github.com/aymenfurter/rescuebomb) using HTML and Vanilla Javascript. It ended up being a lot of fun during the event. Since then, I wanted to explore the more advanced possibilities of Unity.

[Open Game Art (OGA)](https://opengameart.org/) is a great resource for game developers looking to create art that they can use in their project. However, it can be limiting in terms of accurately expressing your creative vision. Fortunately, DALLE-2 is here to help bridge that gap by allowing graphics to be generated from scratch based on your own prompts.

## It all starts with a prompt

After coming up with the idea to build a game similar to Angry Birds or Yeti Sports, I was able to explain exactly what I wanted out of my project and receive detailed instructions on how to accomplish it within Unity.

"ChatGPT and I delved into an back-and-forth dialogue, slowly constructing the game logic through a series of Unity scripts. The experience was much more fun than my typical Google/Stackoverflow workflow. Here is an example how ChatGPT was producing a score text output:"

## Give it a coat of paint!

After implementing the game mechanics, it was time to get creative — utilizing DALLE-2 to produce game assets and visually engaging backgrounds.

The full process can be easily achieved within a single day. Ready to put your gaming skills to the test? Check out the finished game on [https://aymenfurter.github.io/icyimpulse/Player/](https://aymenfurter.github.io/icyimpulse/Player/), and if you want an extra challenge, try beating my record of 170! The full code is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/aymenfurter/](https://github.com/aymenfurter/).
