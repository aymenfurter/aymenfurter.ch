Himawari-8 provides free live feed images (every 10 minutes) from geostationary orbit. I've put together a small script to get it as a "live wallpaper" in i3.

You can get the one-line script on GitHub: [https://github.com/aymenfurter/i3-himawari-bg](https://github.com/aymenfurter/i3-himawari-bg)

The end result looks stunning with real-time satellite imagery of Earth updating every 10 minutes as your desktop background.

## How It Works

The script automatically downloads the latest Himawari-8 satellite images and sets them as the desktop background in the i3 window manager. The satellite provides high-resolution images of Earth from a geostationary orbit, offering a unique perspective of our planet with real weather patterns and cloud formations.

## Installation and Usage

The implementation is straightforward - just a simple script that fetches the latest satellite imagery and updates your wallpaper automatically. Perfect for anyone who wants a dynamic, real-time view of Earth as their desktop background.
