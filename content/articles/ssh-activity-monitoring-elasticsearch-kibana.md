Keeping an eye on your server's SSH activity from time to time is recommended. I created a dashboard using Kibana/Elastic Search to quickly review and potentially identify any suspicious activity. It is available on GitHub ([https://github.com/aymenfurter/kibana-sshactivity/](https://github.com/aymenfurter/kibana-sshactivity/)).

## Why Monitor SSH Activity?

SSH monitoring is crucial for server security because:

- **Attack Detection**: Identify brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts
- **Compliance Requirements**: Many regulations require audit trails of system access
- **Forensic Analysis**: Understand what happened during security incidents
- **Operational Insights**: Monitor legitimate user behavior and system usage patterns
- **Early Warning System**: Detect anomalies before they become serious security breaches

## Dashboard Architecture

### Data Collection
The solution processes SSH logs to extract:
- **Login Attempts**: Both successful and failed authentication attempts
- **User Information**: Which users are accessing the system
- **Source IPs**: Geographic and network information about connection sources
- **Timing Patterns**: When attacks and legitimate access typically occur
- **Session Details**: Duration and activity patterns of SSH sessions

### Visualization Components

**General SSH Activity Section**
- Failed login attempts over time
- Geographic distribution of connection attempts
- Top attacking IP addresses and user accounts
- Success vs failure rate trends
- Peak activity hours and patterns

**Security Analysis Section**
- Brute force attack detection and patterns
- Suspicious IP address identification
- Unusual user behavior patterns
- Geographic anomalies in access patterns
- Correlation between different attack vectors

## Technical Implementation

### Log Processing Pipeline
1. **Log Ingestion**: Collect SSH logs from system log files
2. **Parsing and Enrichment**: Extract relevant fields and add context
3. **Geolocation**: Add geographic information for IP addresses
4. **Indexing**: Store processed data in Elasticsearch
5. **Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards in Kibana

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Authentication Events**: Success/failure rates and patterns
- **User Activity**: Account usage and behavioral analysis
- **Network Analysis**: Source IP reputation and geographic distribution
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-based analysis of access attempts
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical deviation from normal patterns

## Security Benefits

### Threat Detection
The dashboard helps identify:
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Repeated failed login attempts from same sources
- **Credential Stuffing**: Attempts using common username/password combinations
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Access from unexpected locations
- **Time-Based Anomalies**: Access during unusual hours
- **Account Enumeration**: Attempts to discover valid usernames

### Operational Intelligence
Beyond security, the dashboard provides:
- **Usage Patterns**: Understanding legitimate user behavior
- **Capacity Planning**: Peak usage times and resource requirements
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of access reports
- **Performance Monitoring**: SSH service health and response times
- **Administrative Oversight**: Tracking privileged user activities

## Implementation Benefits

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Live Dashboards**: Immediate visibility into current SSH activity
- **Alerting Integration**: Automated notifications for suspicious patterns
- **Historical Analysis**: Long-term trends and pattern recognition
- **Interactive Exploration**: Drill-down capabilities for detailed investigation

### Scalability and Maintenance
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Handle logs from multiple servers
- **Automated Processing**: Minimal manual intervention required
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable data retention for compliance
- **Easy Deployment**: Docker-based deployment for quick setup

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Environments
- **Multi-Server Monitoring**: Centralized view of SSH activity across infrastructure
- **Compliance Auditing**: Automated reporting for security audits
- **Incident Response**: Quick identification and analysis of security events
- **Risk Assessment**: Understanding attack patterns and exposure levels

### Individual Administrators
- **Personal Server Security**: Monitor home labs and personal servers
- **Learning Tool**: Understand common attack patterns and techniques
- **Security Awareness**: Visual representation of constant internet scanning
- **Baseline Establishment**: Understand normal vs abnormal activity patterns

This solution transforms raw SSH logs into actionable security intelligence, making it easier to maintain server security and respond to threats effectively.
